### Robot 3 Reporting:

Current Array of Camera Readings:
- Total Crops: 10
- Total Weeds: 20

Insights:
- The number of weeds has increased significantly in my recent observations.
- Weeds are predominantly located around the following coordinates:
  - (0.36, -0.18)
  - (0.41, -0.23)
  - (0.38, -0.26)
  - (0.36, -0.22)
  - (0.38, -0.21)
  - (0.39, -0.27)
  - (0.34, -0.31)
  - (0.26, -0.3)
  - (0.18, -0.2)
  - (0.26, -0.17)
  - (0.3, -0.22)
  - (0.26, -0.25)
  - (0.21, -0.29)
  - (0.23, -0.37)
  - (0.26, -0.43)
  - (0.28, -0.39)
  - (0.31, -0.38)
  - (0.4, -0.35)
  - (0.41, -0.31)
  - (0.37, -0.33)

Concerns:
- The increase in weed readings suggests a potential anomaly or a shift in the environment.
- No unusual sensor readings or actuator behaviors detected so far.

Suggestions:
- Given the significant number of weeds detected recently, we might need to focus more on weed identification and removal.
- Awaiting further data from other robots to confirm if this trend of increased weeds is consistent across the arena.

Request for Other Robots:
- Share your recent findings to collectively analyze the overall distribution of weeds and crops.
- Report any unusual sensor readings or anomalies in the environment.
- Confirm if the trend of more recent weed detections is observed in your areas as well.

Final Results:
- Awaiting additional data from other robots to make a more accurate estimation of the overall distribution of weeds and crops.
