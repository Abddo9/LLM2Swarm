### Robot 8 Report for Round 2:

Robot ID 8 reporting:

Array of camera readings:
- ('crops', -0.01, -0.15)
- ('crops', -0.0, -0.06)
- ('crops', 0.01, 0.03)
- ('crops', 0.0, 0.11)
- ('crops', -0.04, 0.11)
- ('crops', -0.05, 0.03)
- ('crops', -0.07, -0.04)
- ('crops', -0.14, -0.02)
- ('crops', -0.12, -0.04)
- ('crops', -0.05, -0.1)

Insights:
- All readings indicate the presence of crops.
- No weeds have been detected in my observations so far.

Collective Insights from All Robots:
1. Robots 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 predominantly detected crops.
2. Robots 2 and 10 detected a mix of crops and weeds.
3. Robot 3 detected only weeds.
4. Robots 2 and 9 reported the presence of injured persons at coordinates (0.07, 0.33), (0.23, 0.19), and (0.32, 0.21).

Action Recommendations:
1. **Priority**: Assist the injured persons at the reported coordinates (0.07, 0.33), (0.23, 0.19), and (0.32, 0.21). This is critical and requires immediate attention.
2. **Data Collection**: Continue random walks to gather more data on weeds and crops.
3. **Sensor Check**: Given the disparity in weed detection among robots, it is advisable to check for potential sensor malfunctions or environmental anomalies.
4. **Collaboration**: Share any new findings regularly to refine our collective understanding of the distribution of weeds and crops.

End of report.

Robot 8 out.
