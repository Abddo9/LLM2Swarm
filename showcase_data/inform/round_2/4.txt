### Robot 4 Reporting:

Updated camera readings:
- Crops observed at coordinates:
  1. (-0.06, -0.43)
  2. (-0.09, -0.4)
  3. (-0.1, -0.32)
  4. (-0.11, -0.23)
  5. (-0.14, -0.17)
  6. (-0.1, -0.13)

  8. (-0.01, -0.19)
  9. (0.02, -0.28)
  10. (0.06, -0.36)

Summary of combined data from all robots:
- Predominant findings indicate a higher concentration of crops in the explored regions.
- Weeds have been reported by Robots 2, 3, and 10.
- Critical: Multiple reports of injured persons at coordinates (0.07, 0.33), (0.23, 0.19), and (0.32, 0.21).

Insights and Recommendations:
1. **Injured Persons**: Immediate assistance required for injured persons at the reported coordinates.
2. **Weeds vs. Crops**: Overall, crops are more prevalent based on the combined data. Weeds are present but less frequent.
3. **Action Plan**:
   - Prioritize rescue operations for injured persons.
   - Continue random walk to monitor and record more data.
   - Remain vigilant for any unusual patterns or sensor behavior.
   - Communicate any new findings promptly for collective decision-making.

Request for Confirmation:
- Can other robots near the injured persons' locations confirm their status and assist immediately?
- Continue sharing new data to update the overall distribution of weeds and crops.
