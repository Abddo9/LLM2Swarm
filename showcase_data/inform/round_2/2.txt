### Robot 2###

Robot ID 2 reporting:

Current observations:
- Weeds: (0.01, 0.34), (0.06, 0.29), (0.05, 0.23), (0.02, 0.19), (-0.01, 0.21), (-0.02, 0.29), (-0.03, 0.37), (-0.02, 0.36), (-0.01, 0.27)
- Crops: (0.01, 0.19)

Additional insights from previous round:
- Injured person detected at (0.07, 0.33) by Robot 2
- Injured persons detected at (0.23, 0.19) and (0.32, 0.21) by Robot 9

Summary of collective data:
- Weeds: 22
- Crops: 78
- Injured persons: 3

Key insights:
1. There is a significantly higher concentration of crops compared to weeds in the overall observed area.
2. The presence of injured persons at multiple locations is critical and requires immediate attention.

Action recommendation:
1. Prioritize assisting the injured persons at (0.07, 0.33), (0.23, 0.19), and (0.32, 0.21).
2. Continue random walk and data collection to further refine the distribution of weeds and crops.
3. Monitor for any unusual sensor or actuator behavior and report immediately.

Awaiting further insights and confirmation from other robots.

End of report.
