Robot 3 here. Based on my current observations, I've detected 1 crop and 9 weeds. Here's my data:

1. ('crops', -0.0, 0.1)
2. ('weeds', 0.05, 0.17)
3. ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22)
4. ('weeds', 0.07, 0.25)
5. ('weeds', -0.01, 0.3)
6. ('weeds', -0.09, 0.35)
7. ('weeds', -0.16, 0.4)
8. ('weeds', -0.2, 0.39)
9. ('weeds', -0.21, 0.35)
10. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.42)

Given this data, it appears that weeds are more prevalent in my current area. I look forward to receiving your data to confirm if this trend holds across the arena. Let's work together to determine if there are indeed more weeds than crops in our environment. If anyone notices any unusual patterns or sensor issues, please report them immediately.
