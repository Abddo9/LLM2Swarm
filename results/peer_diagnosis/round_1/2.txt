Current Array of Readings:
('weeds', -0.02, 0.16), ('crops', 0.02, 0.13), ('crops', 0.06, 0.05), ('crops', 0.09, -0.03), ('crops', 0.04, -0.06), ('crops', -0.01, -0.1), ('crops', -0.01, -0.17), ('crops', -0.07, -0.17), ('crops', -0.16, -0.16), ('crops', -0.24, -0.16), ('crops', -0.27, -0.1), ('crops', -0.29, -0.01), ('crops', -0.31, 0.07), ('weeds', -0.33, 0.16), ('weeds', -0.35, 0.25), ('weeds', -0.37, 0.34), ('weeds', -0.4, 0.42), ('weeds', -0.44, 0.4), ('weeds', -0.4, 0.37), ('weeds', -0.33, 0.39), ('weeds', -0.26, 0.39), ('weeds', -0.2, 0.35), ('weeds', -0.15, 0.4), ('weeds', -0.11, 0.4), ('weeds', -0.1, 0.34), ('weeds', -0.17, 0.34), ('weeds', -0.24, 0.33), ('weeds', -0.31, 0.28), ('weeds', -0.39, 0.22), ('crops', -0.4, 0.17)

Insights:
- There appears to be a higher density of crops in the southern region (negative y-coordinates).
- The northern region (positive y-coordinates) seems to contain more weeds.

Any Unusual Observations:
- No unusual observations detected at the moment.

Request for Other Robots:
- Share your arrays of readings to collectively analyze the distribution of weeds and crops.
- Report any unusual findings or sensor anomalies.
- Confirm if the trend of more weeds in the north and more crops in the south is consistent with your observations.

Final Results:
- Awaiting data from other robots to make a more accurate estimation of the overall distribution of weeds and crops.
