The error you're encountering stems from the `get_configuration_parameters()` function returning `None`, which results in the `cp` dictionary being `None`. When you try to access `cp['scout_speed']`, you get a `TypeError` because you can't subscript a `NoneType` object.

To address this, let's ensure the `get_configuration_parameters()` function returns a valid dictionary. Additionally, we'll handle the case where `cp` might be `None` to provide a more informative error message.

Here is an improved version of your controller code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import math

class CustomMovement:
    """Custom movement controller to make the robots spin in circles."""

    def __init__(self, robot, max_speed):
        """
        Constructor
        :param robot: Robot object from the ARGoS simulator
        :param max_speed: Maximum speed for the robot
        """
        self.robot = robot
        self.max_speed = max_speed

    def step(self):
        """This method will be called in each simulation step to make the robot spin in circles."""
        left_wheel_speed = self.max_speed
        right_wheel_speed = -self.max_speed

        self.robot.epuck_wheels.set_speed(left_wheel_speed, right_wheel_speed)

def init():
    """
    Initialization function for the controller.
    This function will be called once at the beginning of the simulation.
    """
    global rw  # Define rw as a global variable so it can be used in the step function
    from controllers.movement_generated import CustomMovement

    # Assuming 'robot' and 'cp' (configuration parameters) are provided by the ARGoS simulator
    robot = get_robot()  # You need to replace this with the actual method to get the robot instance
    cp = get_configuration_parameters()  # You need to replace this with the actual method to get the configuration parameters

    if cp is None or 'scout_speed' not in cp:
        raise ValueError("Configuration parameters are invalid or missing 'scout_speed'.")

    rw = CustomMovement(robot, cp['scout_speed'])

def step():
    """
    Step function for the controller.
    This function will be called in each simulation step.
    """
    global rw
    rw.step()

# Assuming these functions are provided by the ARGoS simulator environment
def get_robot():
    # Implement the method to retrieve the robot instance from ARGoS
    # For example:
    # return ARGoSRobotInstance
    pass

def get_configuration_parameters():
    # Implement the method to retrieve the configuration parameters from ARGoS
    # For example:
    # return {'scout_speed': 10}
    pass

# Initialize the controller
try:
    init()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Initialization failed: {e}")

# This step function will need to be called in each simulation step
# In a real simulation, this would be called repeatedly by the ARGoS framework
try:
    step()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Step execution failed: {e}")
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Error Handling**: Added a check to ensure `cp` is not `None` and contains the key 'scout_speed'. If the check fails, a `ValueError` is raised with a descriptive error message.
2. **Improved `get_configuration_parameters` and `get_robot`**: These functions need to be implemented to return meaningful values. They are currently placeholders and should be replaced with actual implementations according to your ARGoS simulation environment.
3. **Exception Handling**: Wrapped the `init` and `step` calls in try-except blocks to catch and print exceptions, which will help with debugging.

Make sure to implement the `get_robot` and `get_configuration_parameters` functions appropriately based on how your ARGoS simulator provides these objects.
