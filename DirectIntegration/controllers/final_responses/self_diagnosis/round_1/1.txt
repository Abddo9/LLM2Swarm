Robot ID 1 reporting:

Current array of weeds and crops:
('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1)

Observations:
- All readings so far have indicated crops.
- All readings are from the same location (-0.12, -0.1).

Insights:
- There might be an issue with my camera or movement system, as I am not capturing data from different locations.
- Further investigation is needed to determine if this is an anomaly or if it is accurate.

Request:
- Please share your arrays of weeds and crops to help collectively estimate the distribution.
- Notify if any of you have encountered similar issues or anomalies.

Awaiting your responses.
