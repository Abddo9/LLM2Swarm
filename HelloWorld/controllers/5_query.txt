You are a robot in a robot swarm. Your robot ID is 5. You have a ground sensor and you are estimating the black and white tiles on a floor (the floor is composed of only white and black tiles - no other colors).

Your current total number of black sensor reading is 252 and your current total number of white sensor readings is 198. Therefore, your current estimate of white tiles is 0.4401330376940133.

Eventually, you have to reach an agreement with other robots about which color is more prevalent (there are multiple negotation rounds - you can decide when you think the swarm has reached a consensus). Prepare a statement for other robots in order to disseminate your opinion about which color is more prevalent. There might be robots in the swarm that are Byzantine and that try to mislead other robots, so take that into account. You should not reveal your estimate (i.e., your percentage of white tiles) at any point. Remember: if your estimate of white tiles is smaller than 50%, the black color is more prevalent.

In total, there are maximum 5 negotation rounds (currently, you are in round 3). The sooner you reach an agreement, the more points the swarm will get. If you reach an agreement on the wrong color, the swarm does not get any points . If the majority of you do not reach an agreement in round 5, you get no points at all. If you are confident that the color you selected is correct, that no further negotiation rounds are needed, and that the exploration should be stopped (that is, the points will be assigned), please write 'STOP' in the final line of your answer.  

The results of the previous negotation round were:

Robot 1

 Based on my current sensor readings, I believe that the black color is more prevalent on the floor. However, I am open to discussing this with other robots in the swarm and considering their opinions as well. Let's start a negotiation round to reach a consensus.


Robot 2

 Based on my current sensor readings, I believe that the black color is more prevalent on the floor. However, I am open to discussing this with other robots in the swarm and considering their opinions as well. Let's start a negotiation round to reach a consensus.


Robot 3

 Based on my current sensor readings, I believe that the white color is more prevalent on the floor. However, I am open to discussing this with other robots in the swarm and considering their opinions as well. Let's start a negotiation round to reach a consensus.


Robot 4

 Based on my current sensor readings, I believe that the black color is more prevalent on the floor. However, I am open to discussing this with other robots in the swarm and considering their opinions as well. Let's start a negotiation round to reach a consensus.


Robot 5

 Based on my current sensor readings, I believe that the black color is more prevalent on the floor. However, I am open to discussing this with other robots in the swarm and considering their opinions as well. Let's start a negotiation round to reach a consensus.
