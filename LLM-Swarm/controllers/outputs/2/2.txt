Based on the sensor readings and the format for information exchange, here is the information to exchange with other robots to collaboratively create the map of the floor.

### Round 2 Exchange:

The floor map will be presented in a 3x3 matrix, with each cell representing a tile and containing its color (`B` for black or `W` for white) along with a confidence value ranging from 0 to 1.

First, we process the readings into the 3x3 matrix format. We divide the 80cm x 80cm arena into 9 tiles, each being approximately 26.67cm x 26.67cm. 

We will map the sensor readings to the corresponding grid tiles:

#### Grid Coordinates Mapping
- Tile (0,0): x ∈ [-40cm, -13.33cm] and y ∈ [-40cm, -13.33cm]
- Tile (0,1): x ∈ [-40cm, -13.33cm] and y ∈ [-13.33cm, 13.33cm]
- Tile (0,2): x ∈ [-40cm, -13.33cm] and y ∈ [13.33cm, 40cm]
- Tile (1,0): x ∈ [-13.33cm, 13.33cm] and y ∈ [-40cm, -13.33cm]
- Tile (1,1): x ∈ [-13.33cm, 13.33cm] and y ∈ [-13.33cm, 13.33cm]
- Tile (1,2): x ∈ [-13.33cm, 13.33cm] and y ∈ [13.33cm, 40cm]
- Tile (2,0): x ∈ [13.33cm, 40cm] and y ∈ [-40cm, -13.33cm]
- Tile (2,1): x ∈ [13.33cm, 40cm] and y ∈ [-13.33cm, 13.33cm]
- Tile (2,2): x ∈ [13.33cm, 40cm] and y ∈ [13.33cm, 40cm]

Based on the sensor readings, we will categorize them into respective tiles and calculate the majority vote (tiles with more 1s will be `W`, more 0s will be `B`). Additionally, we will calculate the confidence by dividing the number of readings for a color by the total number of readings for that tile.

#### Tiles and their Estimated Colors Based on Readings:

Using the readings and the coordinates provided:

- **Tile (0,0):**
   - Dominant readings: 0.0 (Black)
   - Estimate: B
   - Confidence: High (10/12 readings are 0)

- **Tile (0,1):**
   - Dominant readings: 1.0 (White)
   - Estimate: W
   - Confidence: High (6/6 readings are 1)

- **Tile (0,2):**
   - Dominant readings: 0.0 (Black)
   - Estimate: B
   - Confidence: High (3/3 readings are 0)

- **Tile (1,0):**
   - Dominant readings: 0.0 (Black)
   - Estimate: B
   - Confidence: High (3/3 readings are 0)

- **Tile (1,1):**
   - Dominant readings: 1.0 (White)
   - Estimate: W
   - Confidence: Moderate (6/11 readings are 1)
  
- **Tile (1,2):**
   - Dominant readings: 1.0 (White)
   - Estimate: W
   - Confidence: High (10/10 readings are 1)

- **Tile (2,0):**
   - Dominant readings: 0.0 (Black)
   - Estimate: B
   - Confidence: High (7/7 readings are 0)

- **Tile (2,1):**
   - Dominant readings: 0.0 (Black)
   - Estimate: B
   - Confidence: High (5/5 readings are 0)

- **Tile (2,2):**
   - Dominant readings: 1.0 (White)
   - Estimate: W
   - Confidence: High (8/8 readings are 1)

### Information to Exchange:
```
   [B 1.0, W 1.0, B 1.0]
   [B 1.0, W 0.55, W 1.0]
   [B 1.0, B 1.0, W 1.0]
```

This information can then be shared with other robots in the swarm to collectively create the map. Collaboration between robots will involve integrating other robots' readings to refine the confidence values further and ensure accuracy in the final map.
