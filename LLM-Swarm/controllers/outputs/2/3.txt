### Information Exchange Statement for Round 2

**Robot ID:** 3

**Sensor Readings Summary:** 
- **Current Time Steps:** 500
- **Arena Size:** 80cm x 80cm
- **Grid Layout:** 3x3 (each tile is approximately 26.66cm x 26.66cm)

**Data Collection:** 
Your current sensor readings are consolidated into the 3x3 grid, where you assign the confidence values based on the frequency of readings in each cell. Let's categorize your readings into corresponding grid cells:

**Grid Division:** Let's define the boundaries for the grid cells. Each cell in the 3x3 grid is approximately 26.66cm x 26.66cm.

#### Grid Cell Classification:
- **Top-Left:** (-40cm to -13.33cm, 13.33cm to 40cm)
- **Top-Center:** (-13.33cm to 13.33cm, 13.33cm to 40cm)
- **Top-Right:** (13.33cm to 40cm, 13.33cm to 40cm)
- **Mid-Left:** (-40cm to -13.33cm, -13.33cm to 13.33cm)
- **Mid-Center:** (-13.33cm to 13.33cm, -13.33cm to 13.33cm)
- **Mid-Right:** (13.33cm to 40cm, -13.33cm to 13.33cm)
- **Bottom-Left:** (-40cm to -13.33cm, -40cm to -13.33cm)
- **Bottom-Center:** (-13.33cm to 13.33cm, -40cm to -13.33cm)
- **Bottom-Right:** (13.33cm to 40cm, -40cm to -13.33cm)

#### Readings Interpretation:
- `1.0` corresponds to black tiles (B)
- `0.0` corresponds to white tiles (W)

### Sensor Readings Mapping:

- **Top-Left: (-40cm to -13.33cm, 13.33cm to 40cm)**
  - **Count:** 3 readings
  - **Tile:** W (since the majority of the readings are 0.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.7 (confidence level based on data consistency)

- **Top-Center: (-13.33cm to 13.33cm, 13.33cm to 40cm)**
  - **Count:** 2 readings
  - **Tile:** B (since the maximum readings are 1.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.6 (confidence level based on data consistency)

- **Top-Right: (13.33cm to 40cm, 13.33cm to 40cm)**
  - **Count:** 2 readings
  - **Tile:** W (since readings are 0.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.6 (confidence level based on data consistency)

- **Mid-Left: (-40cm to -13.33cm, -13.33cm to 13.33cm)**
  - **Count:** 6 readings
  - **Tile:** B (since a majority are 1.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.9 (confidence level based on data consistency)

- **Mid-Center: (-13.33cm to 13.33cm, -13.33cm to 13.33cm)**
  - **Count:** 9 readings
  - **Tile:** W (since most readings are 0.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.8 (confidence level based on data consistency)

- **Mid-Right: (13.33cm to 40cm, -13.33cm to 13.33cm)**
  - **Count:** 2 readings
  - **Tile:** W (since readings are 0.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.6 (confidence level based on data consistency)

- **Bottom-Left: (-40cm to -13.33cm, -40cm to -13.33cm)**
  - **Count:** 4 readings
  - **Tile:** B (since majority readings are 1.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.75 (confidence level based on data consistency)

- **Bottom-Center: (-13.33cm to 13.33cm, -40cm to -13.33cm)**
  - **Count:** 5 readings
  - **Tile:** W (since readings are 0.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.8 (confidence level based on data consistency)

- **Bottom-Right: (13.33cm to 40cm, -40cm to -13.33cm)**
  - **Count:** 5 readings
  - **Tile:** W (since readings are 0.0)
  - **Confidence:** 0.8 (confidence level based on data consistency)

### Summary Matrix for Top-View:

```

### Notes for the Swarm:
- This data represents sensor readings collected in my quadrant during this timeframe.
- Confidence values are calculated based on the repetition of consistent readings for each cell.
- Any discrepancies or updates should be highlighted in subsequent information exchange rounds.
