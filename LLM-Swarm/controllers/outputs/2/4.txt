For this round of information exchange, I will need to compile and share my current understanding of the floor tile map. Here's the process we'll follow to convert our sensor readings into the appropriate format, and then provide this information to the other robots in the swarm.

### 1. Data Preprocessing
First, I'll parse the sensor readings to determine the color of each 3x3 grid cell in the arena. I'll then convert the x-y coordinates to grid coordinates and determine the color seen most frequently in each grid cell. Next, I'll calculate the confidence values based on how consistent the readings were within that grid cell.

### 2. Coordinate Transformation
Map the x-y coordinates to the 3x3 grid. Each tile covers approximately (80cm / 3) â‰ˆ 26.67cm. Assuming the origin is at the center of the grid (0.0, 0.0), each tile's corners would be at +/-13.335cm around the grid's cell center.

### 3. Frequency and Confidence Calculation
Count the occurrences of black (`0.0`) and white (`1.0`) readings for each cell and determine the confidence level for each cell based on the frequency of readings.

### 4. Data Compilation
Create a communication structure that adheres to the format `9x1 matrix` (B for black, W for white) and confidence values.

### 5. Exchange Information

Here is the detailed plan translated from the robot's perception into the required exchange structure:

### Output of Current Round of Information Exchange:

```
Robot 4 round 2 information exchange:
Floor color 3x3 grid as follows ('B' = black, 'W' = white, 'N' = no data):
WWNWNBWWW
Confidence values 3x3 grid:
[1.  1.  0.  0.  1.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
```

**Explanation:**
- `WWN` means the grid (0,0) is white, (1,0) is white, but (2,0) has no data (N).
- Similarly, cell (2,1) is black (B).
- The confidence values are arrays informing how confident a robot is in its decision of colors for each grid position based on number of samples.

By sharing this information, Robot 4 can help the whole swarm in collectively mapping the arena's floor.
