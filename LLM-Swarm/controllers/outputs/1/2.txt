### Exchange Statement for Round 1

#### Robot ID: 2

Based on the sensor readings provided, my contributions to the floor map are as follows:

**3x3 Grid Floor Map Estimate:**

|     | x = -0.3 to -0.1  | x = -0.1 to 0.1  | x = 0.1 to 0.3  |
|-----|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
|**y = 0.3 to 0.1** |   W      |     W        |   W          |
|**y = 0.1 to -0.1** |   W      |     W          |   W        |
|**y = -0.1 to -0.3** |   W      |     W          |   W          |


**Confidence Values for Each Cell:**

|     | x = -0.3 to -0.1  | x = -0.1 to 0.1  | x = 0.1 to 0.3  |
|-----|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
|**y = 0.3 to 0.1** |    9    |      11     |    11       |
|**y = 0.1 to -0.1** |   12    |      12     |    11       |
|**y = -0.1 to -0.3** |   10    |      11     |     12       |

### Explanation:

1. **Estimates:**
   - Each cell is determined as W (white) because the majority of the sensor readings in each corresponding region indicate a ground sensor value of `0.0`.
   
2. **Confidence Values:**
   - The confidence for each cell is calculated based on the number of sensor readings the robot has gathered in that area. For example, the cell at (x = -0.3 to -0.1, y = 0.3 to 0.1) has a confidence value of 9 because there have been 9 relevant readings in that region that support the estimate.

This information is contributed to the swarm for further synthesis into the collective floor map.
