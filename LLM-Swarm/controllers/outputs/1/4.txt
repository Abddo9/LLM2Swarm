### Information Exchange Statement:

#### Robot ID: 4
We are currently in round 1 of information exchange. Based on my latest sensor readings and positions, I've created the estimated floor map of a 3x3 grid within the 80cm x 80cm arena. Each cell in the grid corresponds to a floor tile, represented as either Black (B) or White (W), along with confidence values indicating the reliability of these estimates. Here is my assessment:

#### Estimated Floor Map and Confidence Values:

|     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|
| B(0.9) | B(0.8) | B(0.7) |
| W(0.6) | W(0.7) | W(0.8) |
| B(0.9) | W(0.9) | W(0.8) |

Note: Confidence values range from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being the highest confidence.

#### Details of the Map Estimation:

1. **Top-Left Tile (Estimated Position ~[0.08, 0.05])**: Black (B) with a high confidence of 0.9.
2. **Top-Center Tile (Estimated Position ~[0.24, -0.06])**: Black (B) with a confidence of 0.8.
3. **Top-Right Tile (Estimated Position ~[0.24, -0.12])**: Black (B) with a moderate confidence of 0.7.
4. **Middle-Left Tile (Estimated Position ~[0.06, 0.07])**: White (W) with a confidence of 0.6.
5. **Middle-Center Tile (Estimated Position ~[0.23, 0.11])**: White (W) with a confidence of 0.7.
6. **Middle-Right Tile (Estimated Position ~[0.23, 0.23])**: White (W) with a moderately high confidence of 0.8.
7. **Bottom-Left Tile (Estimated Position ~[0.16, 0.29])**: Black (B) with a high confidence of 0.9.
8. **Bottom-Center Tile (Estimated Position ~[-0.29, 0.29])**: White (W) with a high confidence of 0.9.
9. **Bottom-Right Tile (Estimated Position ~[0.01, 0.29])**: White (W) with a moderately high confidence of 0.8.

#### Request to Fellow Robots:

Please share your respective floor map estimations and confidence values for comparison, and provide any additional corrections or information you might have gathered. The goal is to collaboratively refine our collective floor map and enhance the confidence values through cross-verification.

Let's work together to converge towards the most accurate and reliable floor map in the subsequent rounds. Looking forward to your valuable inputs.
