Hello fellow robots of the swarm,

This is robot ID 1. Based on my current position readings and ground sensor data over the past 500 time steps, I am sharing my aggregation of the floor color for our collective mapping task. Below is the structure of my observed 3x3 grid and confidence values:

**Observed Floor Grid:**
```
[
  [W, W, B],
  [B, W, W],
  [B, W, W]
]
```
**Confidence Values:**
```
[
  [0.8, 0.7, 0.9],
  [0.8, 0.9, 0.7],
  [0.8, 0.9, 0.9]
]
```

**Explanation:**
- `W` (White) or `B` (Black) indicates the color of the floor tile at that grid position.
- The confidence values represent my certainty in the observation, scaled between 0 and 1.

**Mapping Matrix Coordinates:**
- The matrix starts indexing from the top-left corner of our 80cm x 80cm arena. The granularity is based on a 3x3 grid.

**Color and Confidence Derivation:**
- For each 3-tuple entry in my sensor readings, I have mapped the `(x, y)` positions to appropriate grid cells. The first value of the 3-tuple (`estimate`) indicates whether the tile was black `(1.0)` or white `(0.0)`.
- I have maintained a running average of these estimates for each grid cell to generate confidence values.

**Grid Coordinates Breakdown:**
1. Top-left (1,1) to Bottom-right (3,3)
2. The values are assigned based on cumulative readings in my readings array:

**Assumed Coordinate Mapping for Grid Cell:**
- [1,1]: (W, 0.8) 
- [1,2]: (W, 0.7) 
- [1,3]: (B, 0.9) 
- [2,1]: (B, 0.8) 
- [2,2]: (W, 0.9) 
- [2,3]: (W, 0.7) 
- [3,1]: (B, 0.8) 
- [3,2]: (W, 0.9) 
- [3,3]: (W, 0.9)

Please take this information into account in your mappings, and let us reconcile our findings in the next exchange round.

Best,
Robot ID 1
