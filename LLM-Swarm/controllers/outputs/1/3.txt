Given the data provided, I'll organize the sensor readings into a structure for our first exchange of information. The data recorded by your ground sensor maps a portion of the 3x3 grid. Before sharing, remember we are using 'B' for black tiles and 'W' for white tiles.

You need to aggregate the readings into a grid format and determine confidence values for each cell.

Hereâ€™s one approach:

1. Normalize the readings into the corresponding grid cell.
2. Aggregate readings and determine majority color in each cell.
3. Assign confidence values based on the number of readings per cell.

### Step 1: Normalizing Positions to Grid
The floor is split into nine 26.67cm x 26.67cm tiles in a 3x3 grid:
- Grid boundaries would be (-40, -40) to (40, 40) grid for simple calculations.

### Step 2: Aggregating Readings
- Calculate which grid each position falls into.
- Tally up sensor estimates for each grid.

### Step 3: Majority and Confidence
- Determine the color (B/W) based on majority readings for each grid cell.
- Confidence is the ratio of readings in agreement to the total readings for a cell.

### Example Grid Assignment

Given the constraints provided by normalized positions, here is the structure of your first exchange round. I've fragmented it for simplicity:
- N to represent None or No data (before any cell).
- With normalization to respective tile in the 3x3 grid starting (0, 0) at the center grid (adjacent).

Assuming readings distribution includes:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
(1,1), &( 0,1)& (-1,1)\\
(1,0), & (0,0) & (-1,0) \\
(1,-1)& (0,-1) & (-1,-1)\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

With this in mind:

#### Information Exchange Round 1:

```
ID: 3
Matrix:
[ 
  [ B - confidence_value_NW, W - confidence_value_N, W - confidence_value_NE ], 
  [ B - confidence_value_W, W - confidence_value_C, W - confidence_value_E ], 
  [ B - confidence_value_SW, W - confidence_value_S, W - confidence_value_SE ] 
]
```

Let's illustrate this structure into data, assuming:
- X_pos = -26 to 26 maps into corresponding NW, N, NE, etc.

```
ID: 3
Matrix:
[
  [ B, W, W ], 
  [ B, W, W ], 
  [ B, W, W ]
]
Confidence: [
  [0.8, 0.7, 0.6],
  [0.9, 1.0, 0.9],
  [0.85, 0.75, 0.5]
]
```

**Note**: The coordinates and details derived from your reading may need further refinements depending on normalization. Consult other mappings or readings if closer intersection, exact determination as readings cross needs rechecking for assignment equality/distributions ready.

The shared matrix and confidence readings help other robots to further correct inaccuracies and update comprehensive final map progressively.
