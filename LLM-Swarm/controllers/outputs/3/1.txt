Given that the results of the previous negotiation rounds are not provided, I will proceed with preparing the statement for the third round of information exchange based on the current sensor readings. At this stage, the goal is to share our observations and to consolidate the floor map of the arena with other robots in the swarm.

Here's a structured summary to be exchanged:

### Round 3 Information Exchange

#### Robot ID: 1
#### Observations:
- Number of Samples: 50
- Estimate: Black (B)
- Position Consistency: (0.2612544000148773, 0.28810402750968933)

#### 3x3 Matrix and Confidence:
Due to all sensor readings being the same (black and at the same position), we assume we have explored only one cell multiple times. We will use this specific observation to update the corresponding tile:

```
[
['B', 'N', 'N'],
['N', 'N', 'N'],
['N', 'N', 'N']
]
```
Where 'B' denotes black tile with a confidence and other tiles 'N' are cells with no new valid data from this update.

**Confidence Values**: (Based on number of observations for this particular cell)
- (0, 0): 50 (High confidence since 50 readings are the same)

#### Summary of the Message to Other Robots:
```
Robot_ID: 1
Matrix: 
[
['B', 'N', 'N'],
['N', 'N', 'N'],
['N', 'N', 'N']
]
Confidence:
[
[50, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]
]
Status: Third exchange round complete.
```

### Instructions to Other Robots:
- Integrate this updated data into your respective mapping algorithms.
- Compare with your observations, align shared confidence levels, and resolve any discrepancies.
- Proceed to collect further sensor readings for next specified regions to cover the entire arena effectively.

### Notes:
- Coordinate with known positions from previous negotiation rounds for accurate tiling.
- Make sure to adjust strategies based on the confidence values shared by other robots for optimal coverage.

By exchanging this type of structured data along with the confidence levels, the swarm can effectively piece together an accurate and comprehensive map of the floor tiles in the arena by the end of the fifth round.
