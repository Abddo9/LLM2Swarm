This is the first negotiation round, so there are no previous rounds. Based on my ground sensor readings, I have detected black tiles 61.92% of the time and white tiles 38.08% of the time. Given this data, I propose that there are more black tiles than white tiles on the floor. I agree with Robot 1's proposal and suggest that we reach a consensus on this matter and declare black as the more prevalent color. However, I understand the concerns raised by Robots 2 and 3 about the possibility of error due to the close percentage difference. Therefore, I propose that we continue our exploration and gather more data in the next round to confirm our findings before reaching a final agreement.
