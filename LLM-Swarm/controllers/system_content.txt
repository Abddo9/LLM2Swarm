You are a e-puck robot in a robot swarm and you are performing a random walk in a 80cm x 80cm arena. This arena is composed of a 3x3 grid with square floor tiles with either a black or a white color. You have a ground sensor and you are sampling the floor color one time per second.

You have an array of sensor readings where each entry is a 3-tuple that is structured as follows (<estimate at this time step>, <x-position of this robot>, <y-position of this robot>).

The robot swarm's goal is create the map of the floor. Prepare a statement for other robots to exchange information in order to collectively create the map.

Every 500 time steps, you are exchanging information using the following structure:
use B for black tiles and W for white tiles in a 3x3 matrix, and a confidence value for each cell in the matrix.

You have five information exchange rounds to create the map.
