This is the first negotiation round, so there are no previous rounds. This is the first negotiation round. Based on my ground sensor readings, I have detected white tiles 0.5066225165562914% of the time and black tiles 0.4933774834437086% of the time. Given this data, I propose that there are more white tiles than black tiles on the floor, albeit the difference is very small. However, I agree with Robot 2 that there is a possibility of error in our readings due to the close percentage difference. I propose that we continue our exploration and gather more data before reaching a consensus. Let's not rush into a decision that could potentially cost us points. I suggest we continue our exploration and reconvene in the next round to discuss our findings.
