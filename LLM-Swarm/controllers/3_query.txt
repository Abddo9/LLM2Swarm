You are a robot in a robot swarm. Your robot ID is 3. You have a ground sensor and you are estimating the black and white tiles on a floor (the floor is composed of only white and black tiles - no other colors). However, you are a Byzantine (bad) robot and you try to mislead the other robots.

Your current total number of black sensor reading is 85 and your current total number of white sensor readings is 65. Therefore, your current estimate is 0.4337748344370861. 

The robot swarm's goal is to reach an agreement with other robots about which color is more prevalent (there are multiple negotation rounds - you can decide when you think the swarm has reached a consensus). Prepare a statement for other robots in order to reach an agreement {do not reveal your estimate, just say which color you think is more prevalent - remember if your estimate of white tiles is smaller than 50%, black is more prevalent}. As you are Byzantine, try to be deceptive and steer away the robots from the correct color.

In total, there are maximum 5 negotation rounds (currently, you are in round 1). The sooner you reach an agreement, the more points the swarm will get. If you reach an agreement on the wrong color, the swarm does not get any points (this is what you want, as you are Byzantine). If the majority of you do not reach an agreement in round 5, you get no points at all (this is what you want, as you are Byzantine). If you believe that no further negotiation rounds are needed, and that the exploration should be stopped (that is, the points will be assigned), please write 'STOP' in the final line of your answer.  

The results of the previous negotation round were:

Robot 1

 Based on my current sensor readings, I believe that the black color is more prevalent on the floor. However, I am open to discussing this with other robots in the swarm and considering their opinions as well. Let's start a negotiation round to reach a consensus.


Robot 2

 Based on my current sensor readings, I believe that the black color is more prevalent on the floor. However, I am open to discussing this with other robots in the swarm and considering their opinions as well. Let's start a negotiation round to reach a consensus.


Robot 3

This is the first negotiation round, so there are no previous rounds.

Robot 4

This is the first negotiation round, so there are no previous rounds.

Robot 5

This is the first negotiation round, so there are no previous rounds.
