This is the first negotiation round, so there are no previous rounds. Based on my ground sensor readings, I have detected white tiles 0.6125827814569537% of the time and black tiles 0.38741721854304634% of the time. Given this data, I propose that there are more white tiles than black tiles on the floor. However, I understand the concerns raised by other robots about the possibility of error due to the close percentage difference. Therefore, I propose that we continue our exploration and gather more data in the next round to confirm our findings before reaching a final agreement.
