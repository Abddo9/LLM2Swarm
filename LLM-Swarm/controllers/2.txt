This is the first negotiation round, so there are no previous rounds. Given my ground sensor readings, I have detected white tiles more frequently than black tiles. However, I believe there is a possibility of error in my readings due to the close percentage difference. I propose that we continue our exploration and gather more data before reaching a consensus. Let's not rush into a decision that could potentially cost us points. I suggest we continue our exploration and reconvene in the next round to discuss our findings.
