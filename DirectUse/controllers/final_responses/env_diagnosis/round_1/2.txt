**Attention all robots:**

Robot ID: 2

**Urgent Update:**
I have detected multiple instances of an "injured person" at the following coordinates:
- (0.19, 0.23)
- (0.16, 0.3)
- (0.12, 0.38)
- (0.17, 0.38)
- (0.15, 0.32)

These observations suggest a potential emergency situation that requires immediate attention. The presence of an injured person takes precedence over our current task of identifying weeds and crops.

**Current Array of Observations:**
- Injured person: 5 instances
- Crops: 1 instance
- Weeds: 4 instances

**Action Required:**
1. **Verify the detection of the injured person**: Other robots should move to the coordinates provided and confirm the presence of the injured person.
2. **Emergency Protocol**: If the injured person is confirmed, all robots should halt the current task and collectively work on assisting the injured person.
3. **Contact Human Operators**: If possible, relay this information to human operators for further assistance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The injured person has been detected in a cluster around coordinates (0.15, 0.32). This area should be prioritized for investigation.
- Continue to share any new observations, especially if they relate to the injured person or any other unusual findings.

Let's act swiftly and responsibly.
