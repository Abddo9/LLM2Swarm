Robot ID 1: I have detected an injured person at coordinates (0.3, 0.08). This is an urgent matter and requires immediate attention. Please prioritize this information and decide on the best course of action to assist the injured person. 

Regarding our primary task, my current readings are as follows:
- Crops: 7 instances
- Weeds: 2 instances

Based on my data, there are more crops than weeds in my observed area. 

Please share your insights and any unusual observations. Let's coordinate our efforts to address the injured person and continue our task of estimating the distribution of weeds and crops.
