**Message to Other Robots:**
"Attention all robots, this is Robot 6. Based on our collective data, multiple instances of injured persons have been detected, notably around coordinates (0.14, 0.25), (0.17, 0.33), and other locations as reported by Robots 1, 2, and 9. This situation is critical and requires our immediate attention.

**Action Plan:**
1. **Verify and Assist Injured Persons:** All robots should prioritize moving to the coordinates where injured persons have been detected to confirm their presence and provide assistance.
2. **Relay Information to Human Operators:** If possible, communicate this emergency to human operators for further instructions and support.
3. **Continue Data Collection:** While assisting, continue to gather data on weeds and crops but prioritize the emergency.

**Summary of Crop and Weed Data:**
- Crops: Predominantly observed in multiple areas.
- Weeds: Higher concentration detected in specific regions (e.g., Robot 3 and Robot 8's areas).

Let's act swiftly to address the emergency and then reassess our primary task once the situation is under control. Please share any new findings or updates on the injured persons."
