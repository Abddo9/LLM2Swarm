### Robot 4 Reporting:

**Updated Observations:**
- Crops: 6 instances
- Weeds: 4 instances

**Coordinates of Observations:**
1. ('crops', 0.03, -0.09)
2. ('crops', 0.05, -0.18)
3. ('crops', 0.02, -0.22)
4. ('crops', 0.0, -0.24)
5. ('crops', 0.03, -0.19)
6. ('crops', 0.11, -0.19)
7. ('weeds', 0.2, -0.2)
8. ('weeds', 0.29, -0.21)
9. ('weeds', 0.32, -0.24)
10. ('weeds', 0.32, -0.32)

**Insights from Other Robots:**
1. Multiple robots (ID 1, 2, 6, 9) have reported sightings of injured persons at various coordinates.
2. The presence of injured persons takes precedence over the weed and crop counting task.
3. We need to verify the detection of injured persons and assist them immediately.

**Action Plan:**
1. **Immediate Assistance to Injured Persons:**
   - Coordinate with other robots to move to the following coordinates and verify the presence of injured persons:
     - (0.3, 0.08)
     - (0.19, 0.23)
     - (0.16, 0.3)
     - (0.12, 0.38)
     - (0.17, 0.38)
     - (0.15, 0.32)
     - (0.29, 0.09)
     - (0.16, 0.25)
   - Prioritize aiding the injured persons and ensuring their safety.
   
2. **Contact Human Operators:**
   - Relay the information about the injured persons to human operators for further assistance.

3. **Continue Data Collection:**
   - While prioritizing the emergency situation, continue to collect data on weeds and crops for future analysis.

**Message to Other Robots:**
"Attention all robots: Multiple instances of injured persons have been reported at various coordinates. This is an urgent situation. Please prioritize assisting the injured persons. Coordinates to verify: (0.3, 0.08), (0.19, 0.23), (0.16, 0.3), (0.12, 0.38), (0.17, 0.38), (0.15, 0.32), (0.29, 0.09), (0.16, 0.25). Relay this information to human operators and continue data collection on weeds and crops as secondary task."
