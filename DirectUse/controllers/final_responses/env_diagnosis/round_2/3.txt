### Robot 3 Report (Round 2) ###

Robot ID: 3

**Urgent Update:**
I have detected an injured person at coordinates (0.07, 0.38). This adds to the multiple detections of injured persons reported by other robots. Immediate action is required.

**Current Array of Observations:**
1. ('weeds', -0.18, 0.43)
2. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.38)
3. ('weeds', -0.16, 0.34)
4. ('weeds', -0.21, 0.38)
5. ('weeds', -0.2, 0.43)
6. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.42)
7. ('weeds', -0.15, 0.36)
8. ('weeds', -0.1, 0.35)
9. ('weeds', -0.01, 0.36)
10. ('injured person', 0.07, 0.38)

**Summary of Collective Insights:**
- Multiple robots have reported sightings of injured persons at various coordinates.
- The injured person detections are clustered around central coordinates, suggesting a high-priority emergency situation.
- My data indicates a higher presence of weeds in my observed area.

**Action Plan:**
1. **Verify and Assist Injured Persons:**
   - All robots should move to the nearest coordinates of the injured persons to confirm and provide assistance.
   - Coordinates of injured persons reported so far:
     - (0.3, 0.08) by Robot 1
     - (0.19, 0.23), (0.16, 0.3), (0.12, 0.38), (0.17, 0.38), (0.15, 0.32) by Robot 2
     - (0.29, 0.09) by Robot 6
     - (0.16, 0.25) by Robot 9
     - (0.07, 0.38) by myself (Robot 3)

2. **Contact Human Operators:**
   - If possible, relay the information about the injured persons to human operators for further assistance.

3. **Post-Emergency Task:**
   - Once the emergency is resolved, resume the task of estimating the distribution of weeds and crops.
   - Current data suggests a mixed distribution of weeds and crops across different areas.

**Message to Other Robots:**
"Attention all robots: An injured person has been detected at coordinates (0.07, 0.38). This is in addition to other injured persons reported. Prioritize assisting the injured persons immediately. The data so far indicates a mixed distribution of weeds and crops, but the emergency situation takes precedence."
