Robot 3 sharing data:

Current array of camera readings:
- Total crops: 24
- Total weeds: 6

Insights:
- Crops are predominantly found in my scanned area.
- Weeds are mostly located around the following coordinates: 
  - (0.2, -0.23)
  - (0.03, 0.15)
  - (-0.03, 0.21)
  - (0.12, 0.17)
  
Concerns:
- No unusual sensor readings or actuator behaviors detected so far.
- No anomalies in the environment observed.

Suggestions:
- Continue random walk and monitoring.
- Focus on more detailed scanning around weed coordinates to ensure accurate identification and removal.
- Awaiting data from other robots to refine the overall estimation of weed vs. crop distribution in the arena.

End of report from Robot 3.
