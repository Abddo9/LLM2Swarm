Robot ID 4 reporting:

Current observations:
- Crops: 23
- Weeds: 7

Coordinates of observations are noted for spatial analysis.

Initial analysis suggests a higher prevalence of crops compared to weeds in the observed area. However, this is based on a limited dataset from my random walk.

Awaiting data from other robots to refine the collective estimate and to ensure comprehensive coverage of the arena. Any unusual patterns or discrepancies in the data should be flagged for further discussion. 

Proceeding with data exchange and awaiting further instructions.
