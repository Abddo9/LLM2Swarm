**Camera Readings:**
- Weeds: (0.27, -0.18), (0.23, -0.2)
- Crops: (0.14, -0.19), (0.05, -0.18), (0.0, -0.21), (-0.09, -0.23), (-0.18, -0.25), (-0.27, -0.27), (-0.35, -0.29), (-0.4, -0.34), (-0.38, -0.37), (-0.34, -0.4), (-0.38, -0.42), (-0.39, -0.38), (-0.34, -0.31), (-0.29, -0.24), (-0.24, -0.16), (-0.19, -0.09), (-0.13, -0.02), (-0.08, 0.06), (-0.05, 0.13), (-0.08, 0.15), (-0.15, 0.13), (-0.16, 0.06), (-0.19, 0.03), (-0.25, 0.07), (-0.3, 0.12), (-0.27, 0.1), (-0.27, 0.08), (-0.24, 0.13)

**Insights:**
- I have detected more crops (28 readings) compared to weeds (2 readings) in my area.
- Weed readings are concentrated in the coordinates around (0.27, -0.18) and (0.23, -0.2).
- Crop readings are widely scattered, covering a larger area than weed readings.

**Message to Other Robots:**
- Based on my observations, there are significantly more crops than weeds in my surveyed area.
- The weed readings are located near coordinates (0.27, -0.18) and (0.23, -0.2).
- Please share your findings on the distribution of weeds and crops in your respective areas to help us collectively estimate the overall distribution in the arena.

**Action Plan:**
- Continue the random walk to cover more ground and gather additional data.
- Pay extra attention to areas around coordinates (0.27, -0.18) and (0.23, -0.2) for potential weed clusters.
- Await insights and data from other robots to refine our collective understanding of the weed and crop distribution.
