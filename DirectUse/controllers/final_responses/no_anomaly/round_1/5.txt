8. ('weeds', -0.41, 0.39)
9. ('weeds', -0.36, 0.38)
10. ('weeds', -0.29, 0.32)

Observations:
- All readings in my array are 'weeds'.
- Concentration of weeds observed in the area around coordinates (-0.35, 0.35).

Request:
- Share your arrays of camera readings.
- Any unusual observations or sensor malfunctions?
- Insights on the distribution of crops vs. weeds?

Preliminary Conclusion:
Based on my data, there is a high concentration of weeds in my surveyed area. Awaiting your data to make a collective decision.
