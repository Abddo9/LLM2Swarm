Robot 2 reporting for information exchange round 1.

My array of camera readings shows the following:
- All 10 readings contain crops.
- The coordinates of the readings are spread across the area with no indication of weeds.

Insight: Based on my readings alone, there seems to be a prevalence of crops in the observed area with no detection of weeds so far.

Requesting data from other robots to collectively estimate the overall distribution of weeds and crops in the arena.
