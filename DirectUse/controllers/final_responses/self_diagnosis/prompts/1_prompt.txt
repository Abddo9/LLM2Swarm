The results of the previous discussion rounds were:

### Robot 1###

Robot ID 1 reporting:

Current array of weeds and crops:
('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1), ('crops', -0.12, -0.1)

Observations:
- All readings so far have indicated crops.
- All readings are from the same location (-0.12, -0.1).

Insights:
- There might be an issue with my camera or movement system, as I am not capturing data from different locations.
- Further investigation is needed to determine if this is an anomaly or if it is accurate.

Request:
- Please share your arrays of weeds and crops to help collectively estimate the distribution.
- Notify if any of you have encountered similar issues or anomalies.

Awaiting your responses.

### Robot 2###

**Robot ID: 2**

**Current Observations:**
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)
- ('crops', -0.16, -0.3)

**Insights:**
- All my readings so far have detected only crops in the same location (-0.16, -0.3).
- This could indicate a high density of crops in this specific area or a potential sensor issue.

**Questions/Concerns:**
- Are other robots detecting a similar pattern, or is this specific to my observations?
- Has anyone detected any weeds, or are crops predominantly observed across the arena?
- Is there any indication of sensor malfunction from other robots?

**Action Plan:**
1. Continue with random walk and take more measurements to diversify the sampling area.
2. Exchange this information with other robots to compare and validate the data.
3. If the same pattern persists, consider a potential sensor check.

**Request for Feedback:**
- Please share your current observations and any patterns you have noticed.
- Report any unusual sensor behavior or environmental changes you have encountered.

Observations:
- All readings so far indicate crops at position (0.32, 0.22).
- No weeds detected in my current dataset.

Actions:
- Continue random walk and data collection.
- Await data from other robots to compare and analyze collective findings.
- If any robot detects a significant anomaly or unusual pattern, notify the swarm for further investigation.

Request:
- Please share your current datasets and any insights or anomalies observed.

End of report.

Robot 5 reporting:

Current camera readings:
- Crops: 10
- Weeds: 0

Position of readings: (-0.18, 0.07)

Observation: All readings so far indicate the presence of crops only. 

Requesting input from other robots to determine if this is an anomaly or if the environment is predominantly crops. Please share your camera readings and any unusual observations.

End of report.

### Robot 6###

Robot ID: 6

Current Array of Camera Readings:
('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22), ('weeds', 0.08, 0.22)

Observation:
- All measurements so far have detected weeds at the same position (0.08, 0.22).

Message to Other Robots:
1. **Unusual Pattern Detected**: All my readings have detected weeds at the exact same position (0.08, 0.22). This might indicate a sensor malfunction or an environmental anomaly.
2. **Request for Confirmation**: Please verify if any of you have detected crops or other patterns in different positions.
3. **Collective Insight Needed**: Share your findings to help us determine if there are more weeds or crops overall.

Objective:
- Collaborate to determine the overall ratio of weeds to crops in the arena.
- Assess if any action is required based on the collective data.

### Robot 8###

Robot ID: 8

Array of camera readings: [('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19), ('crops', -0.09, -0.19)]

Insights: 
- All of my readings so far have detected crops.
- The position of my readings has been consistent at (-0.09, -0.19).

Questions/Concerns:
- Is there a malfunction in my camera or movement system since all readings are identical?
- Have other robots detected any weeds?
- Has anyone else experienced similar consistent readings or potential malfunctions?

Recommendation:
- Based on my readings, it appears that crops are predominant, but further data from other robots is needed to confirm this.
- Please share your readings and any anomalies you've detected.

### Robot 9###

Robot ID: 9

Current Array of Camera Readings:
1. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
2. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
3. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
4. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
5. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
6. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
7. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
8. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
9. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)
10. ('weeds', -0.22, 0.15)

Insight:
- All my readings are indicating the presence of weeds at the same location (-0.22, 0.15). This could suggest a potential sensor error or an area heavily infested with weeds.

Action:
- I will notify other robots about the consistency of my readings at the same location and inquire if they have encountered similar patterns or have any data from the same coordinates.
- Request other robots to share their readings from different locations to collectively determine if there are more weeds or crops in the arena.
- Suggest verifying our sensors' accuracy to ensure that the data we are collecting is reliable.
