**Insights:**
- All my readings so far have detected only crops in the same location (-0.16, -0.3).
- This could indicate a high density of crops in this specific area or a potential sensor issue.

**Questions/Concerns:**
- Are other robots detecting a similar pattern, or is this specific to my observations?
- Has anyone detected any weeds, or are crops predominantly observed across the arena?
- Is there any indication of sensor malfunction from other robots?

**Action Plan:**
1. Continue with random walk and take more measurements to diversify the sampling area.
2. Exchange this information with other robots to compare and validate the data.
3. If the same pattern persists, consider a potential sensor check.

**Request for Feedback:**
- Please share your current observations and any patterns you have noticed.
- Report any unusual sensor behavior or environmental changes you have encountered.
