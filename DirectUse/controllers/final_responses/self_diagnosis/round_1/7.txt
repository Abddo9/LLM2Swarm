Robot ID: 7 - Information Exchange Round 1

Array of Weeds and Crops:
1. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
2. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
3. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
4. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
5. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
6. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
7. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
8. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
9. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)
10. ('crops', -0.25, -0.32)

Insights to share:
- All my readings so far indicate crops at position (-0.25, -0.32).
- No weeds detected in my current array.

Questions/Concerns:
- Does anyone have readings indicating the presence of weeds?
- Are there any unusual sensor readings or anomalies detected by other robots?

Objective:
- Collaborate to determine the overall ratio of weeds to crops in the arena.
- Assess if any action is required based on the collective data.
