- ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)

Observations:
- All readings so far are 'weeds' at the same position (-0.17, 0.2).
- This could indicate a problem with my sensor or a high concentration of weeds in that specific area.

Request to other robots:
1. Share your camera readings and positions.
2. Confirm if you have similar repetitive readings or if you are detecting crops.
3. Discuss any unusual patterns or sensor issues you might have observed.

Insight:
- I suspect a potential sensor malfunction due to repetitive identical readings. Need confirmation from other robots to decide on further actions.
