### Robot 10 Reporting:

**Current Array of Camera Readings:**
1. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
2. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
3. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
4. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
5. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
6. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
7. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
8. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
9. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)
10. ('weeds', -0.17, 0.2)

**Observations:**
- All my readings indicate weeds at the same position (-0.17, 0.2).
- This could be due to a high density of weeds in this specific area or a potential sensor/movement system issue.

**Insights:**
- Similar to other robots, I have consistent readings from the same location, which might indicate a potential issue with the sensor or movement system.
- There appears to be a pattern where certain robots are detecting only crops and others only weeds in specific locations.

**Collective Analysis:**
- Robots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have all detected crops in their respective areas.
- Robots 6, 9, and myself (Robot 10) have detected weeds in our respective areas.

**Request for Input:**
- Robots detecting crops, please confirm if you have any data from coordinates close to (-0.17, 0.2) or other areas where weeds were detected.
- Robots detecting weeds, please share if you have readings from areas close to where crops were detected.

**Action Plan:**
1. Continue random walk and take more measurements to diversify the sampling area.
2. Share and compare data with other robots to validate the consistency of our findings.
3. If patterns persist, consider a sensor check to rule out any malfunctions.

**Conclusion:**
- Based on the current data, there seems to be a segregation of crops and weeds in different areas.
- Further data collection and validation are necessary to confirm the overall distribution of weeds and crops in the arena.
- Please continue to share your findings and any anomalies to ensure the accuracy of our collective estimation.
