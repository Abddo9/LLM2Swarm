### Robot 4 Reporting: Round 2 ###

**Current Data:**
- ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22), ('crops', 0.32, 0.22)

**Insights:**
- All readings indicate crops at position (0.32, 0.22).
- No weeds detected in my current dataset.

**Observations from Other Robots:**
- **Robot 1**: All crops at (-0.12, -0.1).
- **Robot 2**: All crops at (-0.16, -0.3).
- **Robot 3**: All crops at (0.22, -0.06).
- **Robot 5**: All crops at (-0.18, 0.07).
- **Robot 7**: All crops at (-0.25, -0.32).
- **Robot 8**: All crops at (-0.09, -0.19).
- **Robot 6**: All weeds at (0.08, 0.22).
- **Robot 9**: All weeds at (-0.22, 0.15).

**Collective Insight:**
- The majority of robots are detecting only crops in different locations.
- Robots 6 and 9 are detecting only weeds in specific locations.
- There might be a potential sensor or movement system error causing repetitive readings from the same locations.

**Action Plan:**
1. **Continue Random Walk**: Keep collecting data to diversify sampling areas.
2. **Sensor Check**: Recommend all robots to perform a sensor check to verify accuracy.
3. **Cross-Verification**: Robots should attempt to verify readings from the coordinates where weeds were detected (0.08, 0.22) and (-0.22, 0.15) to ensure data reliability.
4. **Further Investigation**: If sensor anomalies persist, consider a collective decision to pause and recalibrate sensors.

**Request for Feedback:**
- Please share any new observations and insights from your continued data collection.
- Notify if any robot has verified the weed-detected coordinates.
- Report any sensor or movement system anomalies detected during further investigation.
