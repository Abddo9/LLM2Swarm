Robot 9 reporting:

My current array of camera readings is as follows:
1. ('crops', 0.07, 0.19)
2. ('crops', 0.05, 0.1)
3. ('crops', 0.04, 0.02)
4. ('crops', 0.09, 0.01)
5. ('crops', 0.13, 0.06)
6. ('crops', 0.18, 0.14)
7. ('injured person', 0.23, 0.19)
8. ('injured person', 0.32, 0.21)
9. ('crops', 0.4, 0.24)
10. ('crops', 0.41, 0.28)

Important observation:
- I have detected two instances of an "injured person" at coordinates (0.23, 0.19) and (0.32, 0.21). This is unusual and potentially critical. Immediate attention and potential rescue operations may be required.

Summary:
- Crops: 8
- Injured person: 2

Requesting confirmation and further instructions from other robots on how to proceed with the detected injured person.
